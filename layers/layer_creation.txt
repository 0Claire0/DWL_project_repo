-------# Creating a layer in the (AWS) terminal for the required libraries. Layers are to be added in the relative lambda functions (check the layers_to_be_created file)



# Check the Python version (the following code is for Python 3.8 - alternative for Python 3.9)
python -V

# Create a new directory (adapt the folder_name):
mkdir folder_name

# Go into the new directory (adapt the folder_name):
cd folder_name

# Create the virtual environment
virtualenv v-env

# Alternative for Python 3.9:
# python3.9 -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
source ./v-env/bin/activate

# Alternative for Python 3.9:
# source myenv/bin/activate

# Install the required libraries (adapt the library_name):
pip install library_name
pip install library_name

# Save the installed libraries into a requirements file
pip freeze >> requirements.txt

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate

# Compress the virtual environment that contains all the libraries into a zip file (that is the layer)

mkdir python
cd python
cp -r ../v-env/lib/python3.8/site-packages/* .

# Alternative for Python 3.9:
# cp -r ../myenv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/* .

cd ..

# Create the zip file (adapt the aws_layer_name)
zip -r aws_layer_name.zip python

# To be run only in AWS terminal (adapt the aws_layer_name):
aws lambda publish-layer-version --layer-name aws_layer_name --zip-file fileb://aws_layer_name.zip --compatible-runtimes python3.8
